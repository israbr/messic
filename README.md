MESSIC
======

Messic comes from the union of two words:
  - **Mess**: _A dirty or untidy state of things or of a place_
  - **Music**: _Vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion_

The aim for the project is to convert this mess of music in a real ordered music, an ordered catalog music and play it in a confortable way.  The main characteristics will be:

* It order our catalog of music as automatic as possible, and it is owned only by you. You can go always to the file system where you are saving it and get it.
* It play the music in a very very confortable and beautiful interface.
* It is executed via web, so we could publish this service at home for every device.
* It is multiuser.
* It's focused at home catalog music. We want to manage and listen to our own catalog of music.
